<h3>Templates</h3>
A template is a file that we can re-use to present different information in a consistent format â€“ for example, you could use a template to help you write a letter,
because although each letter might contain a different message and be addressed to a different person, they will share the same format.

A Django template's format is described in a language called HTML.
